# Why was Pandas Created?

Pandas was created in order to get "better performance" than excel around 2007 by Wes McKinney. 

If you would like to learn more about the history of pandas, refer to this website:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)

# How to Install Pandas?

1. Open up a new terminal window

2. Type in and run "pip install pandas"

If you want to install pandas through the anaconda distribution, refer to this website:

# Creating a pandas dataframe

1. Now you can import pandas in your text editor of choice in python and save it as the common alias of pd


2. Read in the data using the pd.read_csv() function

<img width="549" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-23 at 9 22 03 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134536159-90eef18b-ab36-41e1-92ad-80aaaccc9e61.png">

## TIP ##

Don't forget to have the dataset saved in the same directory as where your python file is located at. If it is not in the same location then it will give you an error saying that it does not recognize the .csv file name.

<img width="446" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-23 at 9 20 50 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134535966-1123e000-b3f7-475c-84fe-4675e715d998.png">


3. The type of the df object is now a pandas DataFrame which gives us a lot of data manipulation power.

4. At this point, you no longer need to explicitly reference the alias pd since we have already loaded the data using pandas. The data is now a pandas object which means we can now use the different features of pandas.

5. You can use the set_index() function on a column in the dataset that is a unique value for the dataset. From there you can use the .loc with the square brackets in order to subset the dataset based on one of the new index values. Here I reference the Student_ID of 1 which returns the associated information with that index.

# Multi-Level Indexing

In order to understand multi-level indexing, you would first need to understand indexing at a single level. Now that we have run through a single level indexing example, we can move onto looking at multi-level indexing.

1. Read in the new data set that has a little bit more information. You can see that Student 1 is in several classes each with a different letter grade.

2. Once you are trying to index based on multiple levels, then the two column values that you want to become your indeces should give you a unique value when used together. Use .set_index() on Student_ID and Class in order to be able to find the unique grade for that combination of information.

<img width="446" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 9 21 39 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134700243-468d20de-dc15-4a73-b278-63d2db0acdef.png">

3. Now when you sort the index you can see how the different levels of the index are set up with the Student_ID being "grouped" together with each of the classes that student is taking. 

<img width="281" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 9 28 53 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134701226-1f42ed15-a640-437e-b595-377626f2f3b9.png">

## TIP ##

The order does matter when trying to subset the dataframe using the multiple indeces. If you have the order wrong you will get a KeyError saying that it doesn't recognize the index that you are trying to use.

<img width="568" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 9 30 15 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134701532-805fc3ce-f280-4bb1-8635-233023563294.png">

4. Since I created my multiple indeces based on the Student_ID first and then the class, I need to index in that order. And when I index in the correct order, I get the letter grade of A back.

<img width="334" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 9 31 51 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134701756-7835997f-1e27-475c-8255-6d8398f77cdc.png">

# Pandas Groupby

You may have noticed if you have done SQL coding that multi level indexing is fairly similar to the groupby function. Here is an example of the groupby function so that you may be able to compare the outputs to each other.

1. Read in the numeric grade data set and then use .groupby() with the columns you are wanting to group in square brackets. Then you can include an aggregate function at the end, with this case being mean().

<img width="474" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 2 55 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134738758-24febc3c-6432-46f9-935b-eb43b574cd2d.png">

## TIP ##

If you do not include an aggregate function like sum() or mean() at the end, it will simply output that you have a pandas groupby object that was created.

<img width="570" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 2 53 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134738584-4dee46a8-aa03-4be3-8d9f-98dd58ceb994.png">

2. From Step 1 you can see that it included the average of terms 1 and 2 for the term column which is meaningless for this example. You can then select which columns you would like to keep for the output right after the parentheses for the group by and before the aggregate function of choice.

# Concatenating Files Vertically

1. If you are needing to add another dataset vertically onto the original dataset (meaning that the columns will match up with the previous information), then you can use the pandas concat function.

<img width="484" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 9 55 20 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134705063-6cffee9b-1683-435b-aae8-043995c2cc7a.png">

2. This shows the new student information added to the previous dataset. 

<img width="190" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 9 56 11 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134705254-1dd407c5-0cf5-4103-b2a3-6823da625d21.png">

## TIP ##
Make sure that before you concatenate the two files together, that you re-read in the files that you had set multiple indeces for. The reason behind re-reading the files in is because it will still concatenate the two files, but it won't put the data where you were hoping it would go. The multiple indeces that were created for that dataset will go into the index column and then fill the index columns with NaN values.

3. Once you read in both of the files again and concatenate them together you can then use the set_index() and the sort_index() functions in order to have the data (and in this case being new students) be sorted properly.

# Pandas Version of SQL's Join is "Merge"

1. Here is a data set where there is a column in common to our previous dataset. This is an example where we would want to use pandas merge function which would allow us to combine the two data frames.

<img width="453" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 2 05 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134733639-f9443aa5-8f5c-417b-83bf-1f76df847239.png">

2. Give the merge function the two names of the data frames as the left and right arguments, and specify the column in common for the "on" argument.
